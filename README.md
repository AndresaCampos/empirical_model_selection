# Empirical Model Selection Data

Here you can find the data used in my paper [An empirical approach to model selection: weak lensing and intrinsic alignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02800).

We included 

- the simulated noiseless data vectors assuming the TATT model for Intrinsic Aligments; 
- the chains ran on those datavelors using the Polychord sampler for both Intrinsic Alignment models we used in the paper: NLA and TATT;
- the Importance Sampling runs for each data vector.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
